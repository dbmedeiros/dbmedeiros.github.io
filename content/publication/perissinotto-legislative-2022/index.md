abstract: The study of legislatures is a critical subfield in Political Science due
  to the omnipresence of assemblies and their impact on democratic governance. This
  subfield, particularly under neo-institutionalism, examines how the internal organization
  and decision-making processes within legislatures influence public policy outcomes.
  Key questions focus on the rules and procedures that shape the influence of various
  legislative bodies. This chapter provides an overview of comparative legislative
  studies, highlighting significant theories and methods. While not exhaustive, it
  points out major themes and exemplary studies. Initially, it reviews foundational
  research on the U.S. Congress from the 1970s, which laid the groundwork for the
  subfield. The chapter then explores the expansion of comparative research to legislatures
  worldwide, particularly noting the institutionalist approach that dominates current
  studies. Special attention is given to Latin American legislative studies due to
  the region's unique multiparty presidential systems. Further, the chapter examines
  Brazilian legislative studies, identifying key themes that align with comparative
  analysis theories. Methodological approaches and empirical strategies in comparative
  legislative research are also discussed. The chapter concludes with brief final
  considerations.
