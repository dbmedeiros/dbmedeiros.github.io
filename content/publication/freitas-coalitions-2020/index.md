abstract: This study aims to understand the behavior of Brazilian Deputies and Senators
  in nominal votes vis-à-vis party strategies of coalition participation. We contribute
  to the discussion on the formation, operation, and maintenance of government coalitions
  in multiparty presidential systems. The assumption of a unidimensional preference
  distribution in the Brazilian Legislature, characterized by government-opposition
  conflict, has been widely accepted. However, previous research has primarily focused
  on the Chamber of Deputies, neglecting potential specificities of the Federal Senate.
  Our first concern is to introduce the Senate into the analysis to determine if it
  can also be characterized as unidimensional and if, like the Chamber, the distribution
  of senators reflects the government-opposition divide. Secondly, we explore the
  explanations for this pattern, particularly examining whether formal entry or exit
  from a coalition party influences legislative behavior. These inquiries underscore
  our aim to shed light on preference aggregation and the impact of government coalition
  participation. We outline our methodology, discuss the dimensionality issue, evaluate
  the coalition's influence on legislative behavior, and conclude with final remarks.
