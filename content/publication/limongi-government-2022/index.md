publication: '*Brazil under Bolsonaro. How endangered is democracy?*'
abstract: "The word \\\"grotesque\\\" originates from \\\"grotto\\\" and typically
  refers to figures in art and literature that are discomforting, bizarre, or evoke
  pity. The Oxford English Dictionary defines it as \\\"strange in a way that is unpleasant
  or offensive\\\" or \\\"extremely ugly in a strange way that is often frightening
  or funny\\\". \\\"Grotesque\\\" aptly describes the two and a half years of Bolsonaro's
  administration. To be straightforward: Bolsonaro has not governed; he avoids taking
  responsibility for decisions and fails to engage in defining priorities or setting
  the agenda. His primary political objective appears to be dismantling policies adopted
  post-re-democratization, which he perceives as part of the leftist agenda of previous
  governments. This negative political agenda lacks alternatives. While Guedes and
  staunch neoliberals view this as positive, considering the state's intervention
  in the economy as the problem, their agenda remains negative as they lack substantial
  proposals for reform. Despite advocating for market-oriented reforms, the Guedes
  team has yet to deliver. The pandemic exacerbated this issue, highlighting the challenge
  of having state skeptics in charge when state intervention became crucial."
