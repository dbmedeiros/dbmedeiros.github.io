 abstract = {The word "grotesque" originates from "grotto" and typically refers to figures in art and literature that are discomforting, bizarre, or evoke pity. The Oxford English Dictionary defines it as "strange in a way that is unpleasant or offensive" or "extremely ugly in a strange way that is often frightening or funny". "Grotesque" aptly describes the two and a half years of Bolsonaro's administration. To be straightforward: Bolsonaro has not governed; he avoids taking responsibility for decisions and fails to engage in defining priorities or setting the agenda. His primary political objective appears to be dismantling policies adopted post-re-democratization, which he perceives as part of the leftist agenda of previous governments. This negative political agenda lacks alternatives. While Guedes and staunch neoliberals view this as positive, considering the state's intervention in the economy as the problem, their agenda remains negative as they lack substantial proposals for reform. Despite advocating for market-oriented reforms, the Guedes team has yet to deliver. The pandemic exacerbated this issue, highlighting the challenge of having state skeptics in charge when state intervention became crucial.},
