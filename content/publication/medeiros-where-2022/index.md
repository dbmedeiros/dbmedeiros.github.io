abstract: Contemporary Brazilian politics is frequently described as \"polarized\"
  by academics, journalists, commentators, and the general public. This term often
  implies a crisis and dysfunctionality, similar to descriptions of other democracies.
  But what exactly does political polarization entail? Is it occurring only among
  the electorate, or also within parties and among parliamentarians? How has this
  phenomenon developed in Brazil and other countries? This essay aims to answer these
  questions and contribute to the discussion about the interaction between the preferences
  and interests of representatives and those they represent. To this end, I provide
  an overview of the literature and present data specific to the Brazilian case. Finally,
  I discuss the possible impacts of polarization on the 2022 elections and the future
  of democracy.
