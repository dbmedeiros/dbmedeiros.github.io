abstract: Why would incumbent politicians adopt the secret ballot when doing so weakens
  the advantages of incumbency? Why is the secret ballot considered a democratizing
  reform in some settings, whereas in others it is associated with democratic backsliding?
  We provide theory and empirics to address these questions. Our starting point is
  the observation that the secret ballot had two consequences. It reduced the capacity
  to monitor the vote, thereby dampening the efficacy of clientelism. Yet, depending
  on literacy and electoral rules, it could also narrow political participation. Recognizing
  this, we endogenize politicians’ preferences over the secret ballot, concentrating
  on the role of their personal and constituency characteristics. Legislative roll
  call voting data from Brazil’s Second Republic (1945-1964) is used to test our framework.
  Consistent with expectations, the level of literacy of legislators’ supporters and
  the strength of their local ties strongly influenced the choice to adopt the secret
  ballot.
