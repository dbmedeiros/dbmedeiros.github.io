abstract: This research note explores whether the government-opposition dimension
  that emerges from voting records of Brazilian legislatures also arises in legislative
  speechmaking. Since the earlier stages of the legislative process are innocuous
  to policy outcomes, party leaders would have fewer incentives to coerce their copartisans’
  behavior in speeches than in roll calls. To test this expectation, this study estimates
  Brazilian political parties’ policy positions, relying on a sentiment analysis approach
  to classify 64,000 senators’ speeches. The results suggest that the president and
  the party leadership exert signiﬁcant inﬂuence not only over how legislators vote
  but also over how they speak. We speculate that these unforeseen ﬁndings are backed
  by the decisiveness of speeches in passing legislation, the importance leadership
  gives to party brand, and legislators’ need to signal their positions to leaders
  and the government.
