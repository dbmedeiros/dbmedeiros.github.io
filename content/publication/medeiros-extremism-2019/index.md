abstract: "Extreme policy positions are not a new phenomenon in politics. Yet there
  is a growing concern among intellectuals, scholars, pundits and citizens from many
  democracies with what seems to be rising extremism, and with polarization at both
  the mass and the electoral level. Extremism and polarization can lead to setbacks
  for social justice and minorities’ well-being, and to democratic instability. However,
  the causes of extreme policy positions and polarization in legislatures are still
  up for debate, especially in the Global South and other developing democracies.
  Income inequality is one of the most important exogenous factors associated with
  extremism and polarization. Building upon the scholarship that investigates whether
  and how the distribution of income influences position-taking, this dissertation
  asks to what extent economic inequality affects the preferences of voters and politicians,
  and whether it influences extremism and polarization in the Brazilian Chamber of
  Deputies. Incentives and constraints fostered by specific political institutions
  are taken into account.   Each of the chapters, written in the format of stand alone
  essays, provides three different approaches to evaluate legislative behavior in
  Brazil. The first essay consists in an analysis of legislator extremism leveraging
  variation across cases. It investigates how differences in socioeconomic features
  of representative’s electoral support bases influences their behavior in the legislature.
  The second essay is an assessment of changes in individual behavior given pressures
  from changing voter and party preferences. Focusing on a comparison of individual
  representatives over time, I ask: are legislators becoming less moderate? If so,
  what is leading to this behavior, the radicalization of party leadership or variation
  in voter preferences? The third essay approach consists in investigating the relationship
  between the time series of the top income shares and political polarization measured
  at the national level in Brazil's two democratic republics."
