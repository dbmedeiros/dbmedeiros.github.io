I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Political Science at the [Federal University of Minas Gerais](https://www.fafich.ufmg.br/) (UFMG) and the coordinator of the Political Institutions and Elections research group at the [Brazilian Center for Analysis and Planning](https://cebrap.org.br/) (CEBRAP).

My primary area of research explores how legislators respond to pressures from voters and parties. I examine pivotal moments in Brazilian democracy to deepen our understanding of political actors' choices and decisions when long-term consequences are at stake.
