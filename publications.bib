	abstract = {According to the new institutionalist literature, the rules regulating a decision making process play great influence on its final result. Thisassumption applies to the 1987-1988 National Constituent Assembly (ANC). Otherwise, a group of legislators dissatisfied with the works course would not have risen with a proposal to reform the Internal Rules after two years of Assembly. The main goal of this work is tocomprehend the importance of the institutional structure for the political contests and the final result of the NCA. Thus, I aim to answer the following question: what are the effects of the rules regulating the convocation of the NCA, as well as the rules regulating its works which have changed during theprocess on the final results? The constitution-making design approved at the beginning (a congressional one instead of an exclusive one) and the organization form of the works (decentralized in thematic commissions) were largely contested because of the consequences political actors were anticipating and looking forward to, since they are always aware of the rule´s impact. The question is whether or not they anticipated it correctly, and for such it is possible to watch how they have behaved. Attempting to deepen the debate about strategic interaction on the constitutional process, the roll calls will be analyzed in order to understand how collective actors organize their preferences, building majorities in radicalized political contests.},

	abstract = {The National Constituent Assembly (ANC) of 1987-1988 in Brazil started without a reference text, aiming to create an inclusive constitutional commission from scratch. This study examines how such a diverse assembly achieved coherent results, focusing on the mechanisms through which various tendencies coalesced to form the new Constitution, and the control and constraint mechanisms used. From a neo-institutionalist perspective, the final outcome was shaped by the ANC's internal rules rather than just individual preferences. This study identifies the determinants of institutional choices made by the constituents. Using rational choice theory, which posits that actors design institutions to maximize their preferences, the study analyzes the role of mechanisms introduced by the "Centrão." It also examines the behavior of this group, noting its lack of homogeneity. A systematic analysis of nominal votes will position the "Centrão" within the ANC's political dynamics.},

	abstract = {Why would incumbent politicians adopt the secret ballot when doing so weakens the advantages of incumbency? Why is the secret ballot considered a democratizing reform in some settings, whereas in others it is associated with democratic backsliding? We provide theory and empirics to address these questions. Our starting point is the observation that the secret ballot had two consequences. It reduced the capacity to monitor the vote, thereby dampening the efficacy of clientelism. Yet, depending on literacy and electoral rules, it could also narrow political participation. Recognizing this, we endogenize politicians’ preferences over the secret ballot, concentrating on the role of their personal and constituency characteristics. Legislative roll call voting data from Brazil’s Second Republic (1945-1964) is used to test our framework. Consistent with expectations, the level of literacy of legislators’ supporters and the strength of their local ties strongly influenced the choice to adopt the secret ballot.},

	abstract = {The word "grotesque" originates from "grotto" and typically refers to figures in art and literature that are discomforting, bizarre, or evoke pity. The Oxford English Dictionary defines it as "strange in a way that is unpleasant or offensive" or "extremely ugly in a strange way that is often frightening or funny". "Grotesque" aptly describes the two and a half years of Bolsonaro's administration. To be straightforward: Bolsonaro has not governed; he avoids taking responsibility for decisions and fails to engage in defining priorities or setting the agenda. His primary political objective appears to be dismantling policies adopted post-re-democratization, which he perceives as part of the leftist agenda of previous governments. This negative political agenda lacks alternatives. While Guedes and staunch neoliberals view this as positive, considering the state's intervention in the economy as the problem, their agenda remains negative as they lack substantial proposals for reform. Despite advocating for market-oriented reforms, the Guedes team has yet to deliver. The pandemic exacerbated this issue, highlighting the challenge of having state skeptics in charge when state intervention became crucial.},

Since the earlier stages of the legislative process are innocuous to policy outcomes, party leaders would have fewer incentives to coerce their copartisans’ behavior in speeches than in roll calls. To test this expectation, this study estimates Brazilian political parties’ policy positions, relying on a sentiment analysis approach to classify 64,000 senators’ speeches. The results suggest that the president and the party leadership exert signiﬁcant inﬂuence not only over how legislators vote but also over how they speak. We speculate that these unforeseen ﬁndings are backed by the decisiveness of speeches in passing legislation, the importance leadership gives to party brand, and legislators’ need to signal their positions to leaders and the government.},

	abstract = {This study aims to understand the behavior of Brazilian Deputies and Senators in nominal votes vis-à-vis party strategies of coalition participation. We contribute to the discussion on the formation, operation, and maintenance of government coalitions in multiparty presidential systems. The assumption of a unidimensional preference distribution in the Brazilian Legislature, characterized by government-opposition conflict, has been widely accepted. However, previous research has primarily focused on the Chamber of Deputies, neglecting potential specificities of the Federal Senate. Our first concern is to introduce the Senate into the analysis to determine if it can also be characterized as unidimensional and if, like the Chamber, the distribution of senators reflects the government-opposition divide. Secondly, we explore the explanations for this pattern, particularly examining whether formal entry or exit from a coalition party influences legislative behavior. These inquiries underscore our aim to shed light on preference aggregation and the impact of government coalition participation. We outline our methodology, discuss the dimensionality issue, evaluate the coalition's influence on legislative behavior, and conclude with final remarks.},

This subfield, particularly under neo-institutionalism, examines how the internal organization and decision-making processes within legislatures influence public policy outcomes. Key questions focus on the rules and procedures that shape the influence of various legislative bodies. This chapter provides an overview of comparative legislative studies, highlighting significant theories and methods. While not exhaustive, it points out major themes and exemplary studies. Initially, it reviews foundational research on the U.S. Congress from the 1970s, which laid the groundwork for the subfield. The chapter then explores the expansion of comparative research to legislatures worldwide, particularly noting the institutionalist approach that dominates current studies. Special attention is given to Latin American legislative studies due to the region's unique multiparty presidential systems. Further, the chapter examines Brazilian legislative studies, identifying key themes that align with comparative analysis theories. Methodological approaches and empirical strategies in comparative legislative research are also discussed. The chapter concludes with brief final considerations.},

	abstract = {Extreme policy positions are not a new phenomenon in politics. Yet there is a growing concern among intellectuals, scholars, pundits and citizens from many democracies with what seems to be rising extremism, and with polarization at both the mass and the electoral level. Extremism and polarization can lead to setbacks for social justice and minorities’ well-being, and to democratic instability. However, the causes of extreme policy positions and polarization in legislatures are still up for debate, especially in the Global South and other developing democracies. Income inequality is one of the most important exogenous factors associated with extremism and polarization. Building upon the scholarship that investigates whether and how the distribution of income influences position-taking, this dissertation asks to what extent economic inequality affects the preferences of voters and politicians, and whether it influences extremism and polarization in the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies. Incentives and constraints fostered by specific political institutions are taken into account.  
Each of the chapters, written in the format of stand alone essays, provides three different approaches to evaluate legislative behavior in Brazil. The first essay consists in an analysis of legislator extremism leveraging variation across cases. It investigates how differences in socioeconomic features of representative’s electoral support bases influences their behavior in the legislature. The second essay is an assessment of changes in individual behavior given pressures from changing voter and party preferences. Focusing on a comparison of individual representatives over time, I ask: are legislators becoming less moderate? If so, what is leading to this behavior, the radicalization of party leadership or variation in voter preferences? The third essay approach consists in investigating the relationship between the time series of the top income shares and political polarization measured at the national level in Brazil's two democratic republics.},
